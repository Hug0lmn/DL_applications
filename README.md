# DL_applications

This repository explores deep learning applications in NLP, inspired by concepts from the Stanford NLP Course.
The focus is on building end-to-end pipelines for lyrics-based text generation using RNNs, LSTMs, and embeddings.

## Roadmap
**Scraping & Preprocessing**   
âœ… Scrape lyrics from Genius [Get_lyrics.py]  
âœ… Clean and prepare corpora for RNNs & embeddings [Cleaning_txt.py]  

**Embedding & Tokenization** [Tokenize.ipynb]  
âœ… Embed words into N-dimensional vector space (FastText, custom)  

**Structure Generation**  
âœ… Transition probabilities between song parts (Markov Chains) [Markov_Chain.py]  
ðŸ”„ Song length distribution analysis  
ðŸ”„ Rhyme scheme detection  

**Character Generation**  
âœ… RNN character-level model [Models/RNN_model.ipynb]  
âœ… RNN character-level generation [Models_generation/RNN_char_gen.ipynb]  

âœ… LSTM character-level model [Models/LSTM_model.ipynb]  
âœ… LSTM character-level generation [Models_generation/LSTM_char_gen.ipynb]  

Find a sample of text generated by the models at [Models_generation/README.md]  
Find the code used for training each model on Kaggle or Google Colab at [Models_training/]  

**Sequence Generation Models**  
âœ… Encodeur-Decodeur character-level no attention model [Models/Seq2seq_no_att.ipynb]  
ðŸ”„ Encodeur-Decodeur character-level light attention (Luong) model [Models/Seq2seq_Attention.ipynb]  
ðŸ”„ Decodeur only Multihead Attention character-level model  

**Word Generation**  
ðŸ”„ RNN/LLM-based word generation  
ðŸ”„ FastText pretrained embeddings integration

## Setup
Install the required dependencies before running the project:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the script directly to fetch and prepare the data:

python Get_lyrics.py --link https://genius.com/artists/Isha

This command will:
1. Run Get_lyrics.py to generate a corpus of songs and lyrics from the specified artist.  
2. Run Markov_Chain.py to process the data and return the transition matrix.  
3. Run Cleaning_txt.py to clean the corpus by removing or replacing invalid characters and unwanted parts.
